## About me :dizzy:
 
I am pursuing a degree in Computer Science and planning to become a software engineer with a focus on AI. I am currently learning modern software design practices and developing capabilities in scalable systems and intelligent agents. 

In the long-term, I want to help build Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and to explore and innovate with future technologies. 

I am and will always be tinkering, experimenting and building through learning - one project at a time. I am always open to opportunities to partner, mentor or to learn. Please don't hesitate to reach out and let's create the future together!  ðŸš€ðŸ¤–
